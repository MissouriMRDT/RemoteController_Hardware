Create libraries folder that has most files
Hardware folder for just hardware
folder for documentation (Transfer stuff to text file, not Word)

*Raname all files to same name (too many names for board, have it all named one thing).

*Have all library files in one folder

*Re-do schematic using grid of 50 mil

*change battery symbol, but keep same footprint (same for 7805, switches, potentiometer)

*change resisitors going to LEDs as 510 ohms

*change LEDs to the two pin standard LEDs (0603)

*Don't connect GND pins directily to pins of componenets, make sure there is a wire in-between them. 

*Show that K is for the backlight

*Show that potentiometer is 10 K

*Make k and P3 flags

*Make sure flags represent whether they are inputs or outputs and not bidirectional

*Standardize the names of the flags for the joysticks

*Change pushbuttons from the through-hole to the SMD ones that are standard for Mars Rover

*change pushbuttons to a 2-pin smd button where 5V is connected with a 10K resistor to the button, pressing the button connects to GND

*Make both TankDrive and SafeDrive connected to Pulled-down to GND with a 10K resistor then given 5V when connected

*Make resistors R7 and R8 10K 

*Make jumper on PCB horizontal, and increase 

*Make a GND plane on the PCB, and then the GND traces can be removed. 

*Also add a 5V plane that will allow for the 5V traces to be removed

*Via's cannot be placed on pads, so move them off of the pad then connect to the via

*Run all traces on 10mil grid

*Try not to use longer diagonal traces, make longer straight traces

*Standardize the name of the board on the PCB to match the standardized name in the repository

*Put red LED for TankDrive to indicate that it is on

for Rev2 bring BOM (Bill of Material)
