While the cs pin (GPIO 15) is labeled for GPIO use, it will casue a boot failure if the pin is pulled high. 
This is labelled SD1 on the board. CMD will also cause a failure if pulled high.
With two buttons remaining, the recommendation is to move the other two buttons to be read either through the 
ADC which currently has two open ports.
The RX and TX ports, which are also labeled as GPIO, will cause prevent the esp from booting if they are driven HIGH at any
time during the load process, thus these pins are not recommended. 
Only current option is to use the the two open points on the MCP3008 ADC
